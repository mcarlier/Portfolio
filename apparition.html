    <p id="apparition-text">I’m currently in Japan, working on this  project  during
      my semester in the FuturUniversity of Hakodate. If you
      want to see images of this work, please come back  at
      the end of January when it will be finished. Apparition
      is an digitale and interactive installation. The purpose
      of this project is to create an immersive experience for
      the user. The installation  is simple, two chairs in front
      of a screen. The  screen is like a  mirror and  display an
      image  of the scene.  A  user enter and sit on a  chair. If
      he stays unmooving, the outlines  of  an  other  person
      will appear on the empty chair.  The  outlines  belongs
      to  the  last person who was sitting on this chair. If  the
      user move during the appearence of the  silhouette,  it
      will disappear. To create the immersion I would like to
      focus my work on the atmosphere  and  the  design of
      the installation. This project will  be set up in February
      during an exhibition in Hakodate . The  exhibition  will
      be about design and expose graduated student works.
