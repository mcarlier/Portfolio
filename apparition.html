    <p id="apparition-text">I’m currently in Japan, working on this  project  during</br>
      my semester in the FuturUniversity of Hakodate. If you </br>
      want to see images of this work, please come back  at </br>
      the end of January when it will be finished. Apparition</br>
      is an digitale and interactive installation. The purpose</br>
      of this project is to create an immersive experience for</br>
      the user. The installation  is simple, two chairs in front</br>
      of a screen. The  screen is like a  mirror and  display an </br>
      image  of the scene.  A  user enter and sit on a  chair. If </br>
      he stays unmooving, the outlines  of  an  other  person </br>
      will appear on the empty chair.  The  outlines  belongs</br>
      to  the  last person who was sitting on this chair. If  the</br>
      user move during the appearence of the  silhouette,  it</br>
      will disappear. To create the immersion I would like to</br>
      focus my work on the atmosphere  and  the  design of </br>
      the installation. This project will  be set up in February</br>
      during an exhibition in Hakodate . The  exhibition  will </br>
      be about design and expose graduated student works.
